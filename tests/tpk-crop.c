// THE SOURCE CROP OF THE .tpk, with no TV.
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. On the Tizen 5 set the aspect button never moved the
// picture. The log showed why: the old path emulates the crop by drawing the
// whole frame into a LARGER destination shifted off the screen, so a zoom always
// needs a negative origin, and this platform refuses one (`display_win_roi_x out
// of range`; TizenFX #514: "libmm_player don't accept negative position when
// rendering by Overlay"). The host reported success because that is only the
// setter's return code.
//
// The fix is to crop the SOURCE instead: ratios of the frame (never negative)
// and a destination that is the whole screen (never off the screen). This test
// pins the three things that decide whether that works:
//   - the ratios are what the slice is, as a fraction of the frame;
//   - the destination is the whole screen, so nothing leaves it;
//   - when the TV does not have the call, or refuses it, the old path is what
//     runs, and it must not have been silently broken in the meantime.
//
// The host is a fake that records the calls. Build and run:
//   bash tests/tpk-crop.sh
